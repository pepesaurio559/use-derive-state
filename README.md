## 🧑‍💻 Usage
Here’s a simple example of how to use use-derive-state in your React component:

```javascript
import React from 'react';
import useDerivedState from 'use-derive-state';

function MyComponent() {
    const [value, setValue] = useDerivedState(() => someReactiveValue);

    return (
        <div>
            <h1>Derived Value: {value}</h1>
            <button onClick={() => setValue(newValue)}>Update Value</button>
        </div>
    );
}
